TASK 02
Cleanse Data using Pig
Notice the comma-separated values of the flightdelays files in HDFS contain
historical data for airline flight delays. The columns in the files match the
following schema:
1. Year, Month, DayofMonth, DayOfWeek, DepTime, CRSDepTime, ArrTime,
CRSArrTime,
2. UniqueCarrier, FlightNum, TailNum, ActualElapsedTime, CRSElapsedTime,
AirTime,
3. ArrDelay, DepDelay, Origin, Dest, Distance, TaxiIn, TaxiOut,
Cancelled,
4. CancellationCode, Diverted, CarrierDelay, WeatherDelay, NASDelay,
SecurityDelay,
5. LateAircraftDelay
6. Write a Pig script that satisfies all of the following criteria:
o Load all of the data in /user/CDAC_ID/flightdelays
pg. 1
o Remove all rows in the flightdelays data where the DepTime column
equals the string "NA".
o The output should only contain
the Year, Month, DayofMonth, DepTime, UniqueCarrier, FlightNum, ArrDe
lay, Origin and Dest
o Store the result as comma-separated records in a new directory in
HDFS named /user/CDAC_ID/flightdelays_clean
o Save the script in a file named flightdelays_clean.pig and save it in
the /home/CDAC_ID/solutions directory on the local filesystem of the
client machine.

TASK 03
Analyze Data using Pig
1. Write a Pig script saved on the client machine as /home/CDAC_ID
/solutions/cleaned_total.pig that calculates the number of rows in
the /user/CDAC_ID/flightdelays_clean files in HDFS. Store the output of
your script in a new directory in HDFS named cleaned_total
2. The Dest column is the destination airport code where the flight ends. Write a
Pig script saved on the client machine
as /home/CDAC_ID/solutions/denver_total.pig that calculates the number
of rows in the /user/CDAC_ID/flightdelays_clean data where the Dest field
equals the Denver airport code "DEN". Store the output of your script in a
new directory in HDFS named denver_total.
3. The ArrDelay column is the number of minutes that a flight arrived late. Write
a Pig script saved on the client machine
as /home/CDAC_ID/solutions/denver_late.pig that counts the number of
flights whose Dest is the "DEN" airport that arrived 60 or more mintues late.
Store the output of your script in a new directory in HDFS
named denver_late

TASK 04
Define a Hive Table
1. Define a Hive table named flightdelays that matches the data stored in
your /user/CDAC_ID/flightdelays_clean directory in HDFS. The Hive table
should satisfy all of the following criteria:
pg. 2
o An external table with the location set
to /user/CDAC_ID/flightdelays_clean
o The schema matches the
columns Year, Month, DayOfMonth, DepTime, UniqueCarrier, FlightNum, 
ArrDelay, Origin and Dest
o The UniqueCarrier, Origin and Dest columns are string types; the
other columns are all integers

TASK 05
Analyzing Data with Hive
1. Write a Hive query for each of the tasks below. Save the queries in a single
text file named /home/CDAC_ID/solutions/flightdelays.hive:
o Compute the average arrdelay of flights landing in Denver
(dest equals "DEN")
o Compute the average arrdelay of flights where the origin is LAX and
the dest is SFO
o Determine which dest airport had the highest average arrdelay



TASK 06
Define and Populate an ORCFile Table
1. Define a Hive table named sfo_weather that satisfies all of the following
criteria:
o A Hive-managed table
o The data is stored in the ORCFile format
o The table is populated with the records in
the /home/CDAC_ID/datasets/flightdelays/sfo_weather.csv file on
the client machine
o The schema matches the columns in sfo_weather.csv - the first
column is a string named station_name, followed by integers for
pg. 3
the Year, Month, DayOfMonth, precipitation, temperature_max,
and temperature_min

TASK 07
Hive Join
1. Write a Hive query in a file
named /home/CDAC_ID/solutions/flights_weather.hive that satisfies the
following criteria:
o Use Tez as the execution engine
o The result of the query is in a new Hive-managed table
named flights_weather stored as a textfile
o Join the flightdelays table with the sfo_weather table
where dest or origin equals "SFO" in flightdelays, and
the year, month and dayofmonth are equal in the two tables
o Select all columns from the flightdelays table, and
the temperature_max and temperature_mincolumns from sfo_weather
